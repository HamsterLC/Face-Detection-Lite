# Face-Detection-Lite(Under Construction)
Here are some lightweight face detection model designed for a project in SmartSens.
All models take MobileNetV2[1] as backbone and with out deformable convolution.

# About SmartSens
Smartsens technology is a high-performance CMOS image sensor chip design company founded in 2011 with a global leading R & D team in Shanghai, Beijing and other regions of China.

* (640) Use VGA 640*480 or scaling by the maximum side length of 640640x640 as input. 
* The other evaluation use Single Inference on the Original Scale.
